    <h1 class="start">How the world keep's using "Old Technologies"</h1>
    <h2 class="second_start">An article about how 1st world countries arround the world uses old tech to keep society running.</h2><br><br>
    
    <h1 class="countries1">1 - Japan (日本)</h1><br><br>
    <p class="japan_text">The first thing to acknowledge is that the Japan government still using this system because<br>
    it's a lot expensive to change to a new system, and in fact since the things keeps working well they don't<br>
    need to change to a new system so, when they saw the real necessities to change to a new system it will be a  lot<br>
    expensive to change so, they just keep pushing foward with this!<br><br>
    <p class="japan_text">The second thing is <b>"Safety"</b>, As you maybe know this old system aren't connect to internet<br>
    and they are a lot safer when the matter is "Hacking" because they work on older languages and work in older hardware's<br>
    so you can't use daily basis tools to hack this, you need the one's of it's age, and it's not easy to find these tools nowadays!<br>

    <p class="japan_text">One of the "OLD TECH'S" they still using is the "Floppy Disk's"<br><br>
    <p class="japan_text">And it implicates on using old computers and old systems, since these Floppy's<br>
    can't adapt to nowadays Technologies.</p><br><br>

    <p class="japan_text">Japan, the technologically advanced country par excellence, is finally starting to say goodbye to floppy disks,<br>
       a medium that was very widespread in the 1990s and is still used in the Land of the Rising Sun by the Public Administration.</p><br>
    <p class="japan_text">The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry - as Japan Today reports - announced that by the end of 2023 it had removed 34 instances.<br><br>
        that impose the use of floppy disks as a method of submitting data to the ministry, and an unspecified number of ordinances that they also impose the use of CD-ROMs.</p>
    </p><br><br>

    <h1 class="countries2">2 - Germany (Deutschland)</h1><br><br>

    <p class="german_text">Another country that keeps using this type of Technologie is <b>Germany</b><br><br>
     You thought that Windows 3.11 and MS-DOS were gone? Well, think again! It seems that Windows 3.11 is still used by the German railway.<br><br>
     In a recent job posting by a German railway company, they are looking for an administrator who will manage an old system and update drivers on it.<br><br>
     Among the necessary skills is the knowledge of Windows 3.1, MS-DOS, and Windows for Workgroups. After further research, it seems that the<br>
     company is using Windows 3.1 to manage railway display boards for most of Germany.

    </figure><br><br>

    <p class="german_text">The system also powers the cab display on high-speed trains and shows the driver crucial technical data in real time.<br>
        It's bizarre to see that the German railway is relying on an operating system that was discontinued in late 2001 for such important real-time information, but if it's not broken, why fix it?<br><br>
        There are a few benefits to these legacy systems, such as reliability and security since there are only a few malware applications that can infect these legacy systems.
    </p><br><br>

    <h1 class="countries3">3 - Brazil (Brasil)</h1><br><br>

    <p class="brazil_text">The banking industry relies heavily on computer systems to manage transactions, customer data, and other critical functions.<br><br>
        Many of these systems were built using the COBOL programming language, which was popular in the 1960s and 1970s.<br>
        As newer programming languages and technologies have emerged, the banking industry has struggled to keep up with the pace of change.</p><br>

    <figcaption class="photo_cap">Cobol Language (Used by most countries Bank Systems)</figcaption>
    </figure><br><br>

    <p class="brazil_text">Estimates as high as 80% of financial transactions use common business-oriented language, or COBOL.<br><br> 
        Now as programmers retire and fewer are joining the workforce to replace them, the future for the language is uncertain.<br><br>
        But rumors of COBOL's demise are nothing new!<br><br>
        You might thinking "It implicates on using associate old technologies?" And the answer is: YES!<br><br>
        It's and old language that can run in new computers, but in order to keep this interacting with<br>
        the system, it needs old computers, old hardwares, and old tools and software as "Windows 3.1, ASP.NET and Floppy Disks."<br><br>
        Nowadays the 2 countries who most uses it we have Brazil and United States!<br><br>
        In a tier list of countries who still uses COBOL we have:<br><br>
        <ol class="brazil_text">
            <li>1 - United States</li>
            <li>2 - Brazil</li>
            <li>3 - Sweden</li>
            <li>4 - Poland</li>
            <li>5 - Switzerland</li>
        </ol>
    
    </p><br><br>


    <h1 class="final">Conclusion - KNEE BEFORE THE ANCIENT!</h1><br><br>

    <p class="final_text">As we can see here there is a lot of things in the world who still<br>
    depends on old technologies, as it is efficient, secure, simple and less expensive to maintain!<br><br>

    <p class="final_text">A Few countries like Japan and Sweden are trying to change these systems<br>
        but it seems like it's going to take a while to change these system to a new one since we don't<br>
        have a lot of efforts to make new system and the governments don't invest money to change these systems<br><br>
        If it's Working, DON'T TOUCH IT"
